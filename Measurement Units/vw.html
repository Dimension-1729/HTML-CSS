<!--
Viewport width works just like percentage units.

Viewport is defined as the user's visible area, it varies with the device,
they're used to cusctomize the layout that fits well on the screen.

There are 4 viewport based units;
1. vw
2. vh
3. vmin
4. vmax     

Important:- "vw" removes the dependecny of any parent element and allows sizing based on the viewport size of the browser. In other words, "%" length is relative to parent element width and "vw" width is relative to browser window width
